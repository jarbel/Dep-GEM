# DepGEM

DepGEM implements the method described in the paper *Bayesian nonparametric dependent model for partially replicated data: The influence of fuel spills on species diversity* by Arbel et. al.

The code in this package (including the sampling algorithm and main functions) was written by [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/home). The package (i.e. the packaging of the code into an R package that builds and passes some checks) was written by [Amy Willis](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/).

*This package is in development mode*

## Usage

Check out the vignette "Getting started with DepGEM" to learn how to use the package.
